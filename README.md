## Driver Drowsiness Detection System

This project implements a real-time Driver Drowsiness Detection System using machine learning and computer vision techniques. The system utilizes a webcam to capture video of the driver's face, analyzes facial landmarks, and computes metrics such as eye aspect ratio and mouth opening ratio to detect signs of drowsiness. Developed in Python, Java, and C, this solution aims to enhance road safety by providing timely alerts for driver microsleep. Key features include adaptive thresholding for accurate drowsiness detection and a user-friendly interface for real-time monitoring.
